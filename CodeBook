Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.
- A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A

###Features and Activities data sets have been combine along with Test/Training data sets to create a single file

###Names of Activities have been cleaned up to make it easy to understand

###Finally a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created 

###The tidy data set has the following variables:

 "Subjects"                      "Activity"                      "tBodyAcc_mean_X"
